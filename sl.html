S. L. Bhyrappa


Santeshivara Lingannaiah Bhyrappa (born 26 July 1931) is a Kannada novelist, whose work is popular in the state of Karnataka, India.[1] He is widely regarded as one of modern India's popular novelists.[2] His novels are unique in terms of theme, structure, and characterization.[3] He has been among the top-selling authors in the Kannada language. His books have been translated to Hindi and Marathi and have also been top sellers.[4]

Bhyrappa's works do not fit into any specific genre of contemporary Kannada literature such as Navodaya, Navya, Bandaya, or Dalita, partly because of the range of topics he writes about. His major works have been at the center of several heated public debates and controversies.[1] He was awarded the 20th Saraswati Samman in 2010.[5] In March 2015, Bhyrappa was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship.[6] The Government of India awarded him with the civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 2016.[7]


Biography
Early life
S L Bhyrappa was born at Santeshivara, a village in the Channarayapatna taluk of Hassan district, about 162 kilometres (101 mi) from Bangalore. He lost his mother and brothers to Bubonic plague in his early childhood and took on odd jobs to pay for his education. During his childhood, he was influenced by the writings of Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar.

Bhyrappa completed his primary education in Channarayapatna taluk before moving to Mysore where he completed the rest of his education. In his autobiography, Bhitti (Wall) he wrote that he took a break during his high school education. Bhyrappa impulsively quit school, following his cousin's advice and wandered for a year with him. His sojourn led him to Mumbai, where he worked as a railway porter. In Mumbai he met a group of sadhus and joined them to seek spiritual solace. He wandered with them for a few months before returning to Mysore to resume his education[citation needed].






Works
Starting with Bheemakaya, first published in 1958, Bhyrappa has authored twenty four novels in a career spanning more than five decades. Vamshavruksha, Tabbaliyu Neenade Magane, Matadana and Nayi Neralu were made into films that received critical acclaim. Vamshavruksha has received the Kannada Sahitya Academy Award in 1966 and Daatu (Crossing Over) received both the Kannada and the Kendra Sahitya Academy awards in 1975.[9] Parva, the most critically acclaimed of all his novels narrates the social structure, values and mortality in the epic of Mahabharata very effectively. Bhyrappa reconstructs the Mahabharatha from sociological and anthropological angle, through metaphors in this novel.[10]
