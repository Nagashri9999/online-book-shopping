Adikavi Pampa

Born	9th century
Died	10th century
Occupation	Poet
Pampa (Kannada: , 10th century), called by the honorific Adikavi ("First Poet") was a Kannada Jain poet whose works reflected his philosophical beliefs.[1] A court poet of Chalukya king Arikesari II, who was a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta dynasty king Krishna III, Pampa is best known for his epics Vikramarjuna Vijaya or Pampa Bharata, and the Adi pura?a, both written in the champu style around c.939. These works served as the model for all future champu works in Kannada.

The works of Jain writers Pampa, Sri Ponna and Ranna, collectively called the "Three gems of Kannada literature", heralded the 10th century era of medieval Kannada literature.
Adipurana
The Adi purana, written in the champu style, a mixed form of prose and verse, is a Kannada version of the Sanskrit work by Jinasena and details in sixteen cantos the life of the first Tirthankara of Jainism, Rishabha. The work focuses in his own unique style the pilgrimage of a soul to perfection and attainment of moksha. In the work, Pampa describes the struggle for power and control over the entire world of two brothers Bharata and Bahubali, sons of Rishabha. While Bahubali wins, he renounces the worldly pursuits in favour of his brother. Many Jain puranas of Middle Ages found a role model in this work.
